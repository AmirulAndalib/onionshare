## Your feature idea

Please write it here.

Please note that we are not looking to add the following features:

 * Ability to host a dynamic website requiring databases or anything not considered 'static'
 * Database backends to store persistent information about use of Share or Receive mode, e.g statistics
 * Chat, voice or other instant messaging services
 * High availability for Onion Services (e.g OnionBalance)
